# Predicting West Nile Virus

For this project I tackled a past Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus

Working in a team of three we manipulated and combined data from three different CSVs to generate a model that predicted the probability of West Nile Virus being detected in mosquito traps throughout the city of Chicago.

My team won a prize for the best presentation in our class, and came within 1/2 of a percent of the top ROC/AUC score in the class.

*Skills used: Data Manipulation, Feature Engineering, Classification, Data Visualization*
