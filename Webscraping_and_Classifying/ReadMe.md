# Web Scraping with Python

For this project, I created a webscraper to collect data from indeed.com, including the salary, job description and location.

I applied a count vectorizer to the description to find the words that most predictive of a salary above the median.

Then, I took the location, job title, vectorized words and other features to create a random forest model that predicts whether a salary will be above or below the median.
