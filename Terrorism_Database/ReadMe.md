# Terrorism Database

For this project I did some exploratory analysis and visualizations on a large dataset - the University of Maryland Global Terrorism Database : https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/

Then I used Monte Carlo Markov Chains to generate a Bayesian credible interval comparing two different periods of terrorist attacks.

Finally, I imputed missing data for the year 1993.
