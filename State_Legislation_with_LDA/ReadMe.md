# Using LDA to Classify and Predict State Legislation

For this project I utilized the LegiScan API to collect information about every bill introduced in state legislatures from 2008 to 2016.

I applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation to the descriptions of the legislation to classify bills by subject.

After looking at the distribution of the legislation over time, I predicted the next year's distribution by applying linear regression.

For visualizations of the process, please see the PDF presentation in this folder.
